### About

Shopware is a modular online shop system developed in Germany since 2004. It is available both as open source software and in commercial editions.

The Buckaroo Payments Plugin for Shopware 5 enables a ready-to-sell payment gateway. You can choose from popular online payment methods in The Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany and globally. Start accepting payments within a few minutes.

**Please note:** Buckaroo took over Sisow in 2021 and thereby all of their plugins. This Shopware 5 plugin is the former Sisow version and it contains a ready-to-sell payment gateway for Buckaroo. However new functionalities will only be added in [Buckaroo's primary Shopware 5 plugin](https://github.com/buckaroo-it/Shopware_5) and not in this specific plugin.
